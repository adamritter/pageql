Okay, let's break down what seems to be missing or could be improved to make PageQL a more complete micro web framework, based on the files you provided:

Core Templating Features:

Missing Tags: The README.md mentions several tags as planned or out-of-scope that are common in web frameworks and currently missing from the pageql.py implementation:
#import: Essential for organizing code into reusable modules/components beyond simple partials.
#each (or similar looping): Needed for iterating over data structures passed as parameters, not just database results from #from.
#header, #cookie, #contenttype: Crucial for controlling HTTP responses (caching, sessions, API content types, etc.).

Raw Output: The README.md discusses {{{ variable }}} for unescaped output, but it doesn't seem to be implemented in pageql.py. This is sometimes necessary but needs careful handling.
View Definition (#view): While mentioned, it's unclear if #view is fully implemented for defining reusable SQL views within the templates.

Parsing Robustness: The parse_simple function in pageql.py is very basic (simple regex split). It might struggle with nested tags, complex attribute quoting, or minor syntax variations, making templates potentially brittle.
HTTP Server & Request Handling (pageql_server.py):
Limited Request Handling: Currently handles URL query parameters and basic application/x-www-form-urlencoded POST data. It lacks built-in support for other common needs like JSON payloads, multipart/form-data (file uploads), accessing request headers easily within templates, or differentiating easily between PUT, DELETE, etc.

Basic Routing: Routing maps URL paths directly to <module_name>/<public_partial_name>. This is simple but lacks flexibility for common patterns like path parameters (e.g., /users/123) or defining multiple routes/methods for the same base path.
No Middleware Concept: Frameworks often use middleware for handling tasks across many requests (e.g., authentication, logging, CORS).

Session Management: No built-in mechanism for user sessions, which usually relies on server-side storage and cookies (requires #cookie support).
Robustness & Security:
Error Handling: Error reporting is basic. More detailed error messages (including template file and line number) would significantly aid debugging. Production environments would need user-friendly error pages instead of showing raw exceptions.

Transaction Management: The README.md mentions atomic transactions per request, but the implementation relies on a single db.commit() at the end of render in the server. This might not cover all cases or provide fine-grained control if needed.

Security: While parameter binding (:param) helps prevent SQL injection in standard queries, the use of evalone to execute arbitrary SQL expressions (even with parameter binding) needs careful auditing to ensure no injection paths exist, especially for expressions passed via #set or #render arguments.
Developer Experience & Ecosystem:
Documentation: Needs comprehensive documentation beyond the current README â€“ a clear API reference for all tags, guides on usage, deployment, and best practices.

Examples: More examples covering different use cases beyond the TodoMVC.
Testing Support: No defined way to easily unit or integration test PageQL applications.
Debugging: Better debugging tools beyond #log and #dump would be helpful.
Packaging: Needs to be packaged (e.g., for PyPI) with clear dependencies for easy installation.

"Reactive" Aspect:
As the README.md clearly states, the core "reactive query" vision (automatic UI updates on data change) is a future goal and not implemented. Currently, it functions as a server-side templating engine that queries a database on request.

In essence, it's a neat proof-of-concept for embedding SQL in HTML but needs significant feature additions, robustness improvements, and developer tooling to be considered a generally useful micro-framework for broader adoption.
